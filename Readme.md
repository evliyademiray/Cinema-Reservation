Hey!

I made Cinema Reservation website.

-I used JS,HTML and CSS.

-Created chairs that selected one is saved on database and don't go anywhere while page reload.

-Also you are able to change the movie and also update the price depends on amount of selected chair.

-Reserved, selected and empty chair have different color and have hover skill.

I hope you like it.

Thanks for support.

See you soon...

Best Regards...
